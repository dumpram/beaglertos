;This API can be used to switch from user mode to privileged mode
;The priviledge mode will be system mode. System mode will share 
;the same resources as user mode, but with privileges.
;All the access to system configuration which needs privileged access
;can be done after calling this API.
;
CPUSwitchToPrivilegedMode:
	SWI   458752
	bx lr
;
;This API can be used to switch from any previleged mode of ARM to 
;user mode. After this API is called, the program will continue
;to operate in non-privileged mode, until any exception occurs.
;After the exception is serviced, execution will continue in user mode.
;All the access to system configuration which needs privileged access
;shall be done before this API is called.
;
CPUSwitchToUserMode:
	mrs     r0, cpsr
	bic     r0, r0, #0xF
	orr     r0, r0, #0x10
	msr     cpsr_c, r0
	bx 	lr

;
;This API is called when the CPU is aborted or during execution
;of any undefined instruction. Both IRQ and FIQ will be disabled
;when the CPU gets an abort and calls this API. 
;The user can perform error handling such as an immediate reset 
;inside this API if required.
;
CPUAbortHandler:
	nop
	nop
	nop
	nop
	bx lr

;
; Wrapper function for the IRQ status
